Wio Lite MG126 is a cost-effective SAMD21 based development board with the on-board MG126 Bluetooth Module. SAM D21 is an ARM Cortex-M0+ based microcontroller and the MG126 is a 2.4GHz single-mode Bluetooth transceiver module. The same with Wio Lite W600, this board is also compatible with Arduino zero( Used the same Arduino Core SAM D21) and has the same compatible form factor with Adafruit Feather series.   
 
We break out the 3.3V I/O pins of SAM D21, SAM D21 chip has rich I / O resources, including 14 digital pins, 6 analog pins, 1 UART port, 1 I2C port, and 1 ICSP port. More and more boards in Seeed use type C interfaces to supply power and transmit data, so does the Wio Lite MG126. Meanwhile, there is a JST2.0 Li-Po battery port, you can use 3.5V or 4.2V Li-Po battery to power this board.  
 

Now, let's talk about the Bluetooth Core, the MG126. MG126 is a 2.4GHz BLE RF transceiver with software configurable registers, embedded packet handling engine. It can work with ultra-low power. The Bluetooth air data rate of MG126 is 1Mbps and MG126 can talks with Arduino core at the speed of 4Mbps via the SPI interface.

## Getting Started


### Hardware

**Materials required**

- Seeeduino Nano x1
- Computer x1
- USB typc cable x1


!!!Tip
        Some USB cables can only supply power and cannot transfer data. If you don't have a usb cable or don't know if your usb cable can transmit data, you can check [Seeed USB type C support USB 3.1](https://www.seeedstudio.com/USB-Type-C-to-A-Cable-1Meter-p-4085.html).


Connect the Seeeduino Nano to your computer via the USB cable.



### Software


- **Step 1. You need to Install an Arduino Software.**

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Stalker_V3_1/master/images/Download_IDE.png)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)


**Launch the Arduino application**

Double-click the Arduino application (arduino.exe) you have previously downloaded.

!!!Note
    If the Arduino Software loads in a different language, you can change it in the preferences dialog. See the [Arduino Software (IDE) page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Environment#languages) for details.


- **Step 2. Add the Wio W600 Board into Arduino IDE**

Open your Arudino IDE, click on **File > Preferences**, and copy the following url to Additional Boards Manager URLs

```
http://arduino.winnermicro.com/arduino/package_wmcom_index.json
```

Click on **Toos > Board > Board Manager**.

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Wio-W600/raw/master/img/IDE-2.jpg)

Now you can search the board by name, just search the `Wio W600` and install the corresponding board.


![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Wio-W600/raw/master/img/IDE-3.jpg)


When the installation finished, you can find demos for Wio W600 at the your PC, the location is **C:\Users\XXXXXX\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\w600\hardware\w600\0.2.7-rc1\libraries**. **XXXXX** is the name of your computer user.
For instance, mine is 

```
C:\Users\seeed\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\w600\hardware\w600\0.2.7-rc1\libraries
```

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Wio-W600/raw/master/img/IDE-6.jpg)


In this wiki we will take WiFi demo for instance.


- **Step 3. Open the WiFi demo**


Turn to the folder **W600WiFi\examples\AP-Sta**, doulbel click to open the **AP-Sta.ino** demo. In this demo, Wio W600 will connect to a WiFi access point to connect to the Internet and then provide WiFi for other device.



![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Wio-W600/raw/master/img/IDE-8.jpg)


As the picture shown above, you should config this part yourself.

- 1-is the WiFi access point you want to join

- 2 is the access point generated by Wio W600.



- **Step 4. Select your board and port**  
You'll need to select the entry in the **Tools > Board** menu that corresponds to your Arduino.
Selecting a **Wio W600**.


![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Wio-W600/raw/master/img/IDE-7.jpg)


Select the serial device of the Arduino board from the Tools | Serial Port menu. This is likely to be COM3 or higher (**COM1** and **COM2** are usually reserved for hardware serial ports). To find out, you can disconnect your Arduino board and re-open the menu; the entry that disappears should be the Arduino board. Reconnect the board and select that serial port.


- **Step 5.Upload the program**  
Now, simply click the "Upload" button in the environment. Wait a few seconds and if the upload is successful, the message "Done uploading." will appear in the status bar.

  <figcaption><b>Figure 13</b>. <i>Upload the code</i></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>



Then, when you use other device to connect to the Wio W600 AP, you serial moniter of Arduino IDE will output:

## Function interface

### WiFi function interface

- 1. WiFi.begin

```
WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
```
Wio W600 work as the station to access the AP. 


- 2. WiFi.softAP

```
WiFi.softAP(ssid, password);
```
Wio W600 work as the AP.


- 3. WiFi.status

```
WiFi.status()
```

Check current wifi status.


- 4. client.connect

```
client.connect(host, httpPort);
```

Connection target, incoming ip address, target port


- 5. WiFi.setAutoReconnect

```
WiFi.setAutoReconnect(false);
```

Set up automatic connection last wifi


- 6. WiFi.mode

```
WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP_STA);
```

Set the wifi mode, optional parameters: **sta, ap, sta+ap**


- 7. dns.getHostByName

```
dns.getHostByName("www.google.com", resolve))  
```

Dns analysis. 



Only some common interfaces are listed here, and other interfaces can view example.
